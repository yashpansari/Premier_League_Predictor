# Premier_League_Predictor

Done so far:

1. Collected and cleaned all FPL data from 2016-2024.
2. Identified features (add feature list here) and dropped all irrelevant columns. Converted all entries to Z scores
3. Split data into training and labels and ran bunch of regression and decision-tree algorithms to evaluate performance of our features in prediciting future scores.

Todo:

1. Solve the optimization problem to build a team to maximize fpl points given a budget.
2. Scrape News articles, add newws feature, and build a transfer suggestion system for future gameweeks.
